# mod-stuff-paradox
Changes the name of the .mod file to the name of the "real" mod folder, adds the correct "path=mod/..." line to them (and deletes the old one) and then moves both the .mod file and the folder containing the mod into a chosen directory.

The program works for two folder structures, one where the .mod file and the mod folder is within the same folder and one where the .mod file is inside of the mod folder.

**Guide**
I provided an example zip that you can try out. All you have to do is unzip the zip file I provided (EXAMPLE.zip) and then unzip each of the zipped mod folders contained within the EXAMPLE/SOURCE/ Folder. After that run the program and select "SOURCE" as the source directory and "DESTINATION" as the destination directory. Finally you can press the "DO IT" button and it should rename and move everything to the "DESTINATION" folder.
