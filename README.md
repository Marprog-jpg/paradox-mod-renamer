# Paradox Mod Renamer
Changes the name of the .mod file to the name of the "real" mod folder, adds the correct "path=mod/..." line to them (and deletes the old one) and then moves both the .mod file and the folder containing the mod into a chosen directory.

The program works for two folder structures, one where the .mod file and the mod folder is within the same folder and one where the .mod file is inside of the mod folder.

I provided an example zip that you can try out.

**How to use the example zip**

1. Unzip the EXAMPLE.zip file wherever you want.
2. Unzip the zip folders in EXAMPLE/SOURCE/ to EXAMPLE/SOURCE/.
3. Run the program and select the "SOURCE" folder as the source directory and "DESTINATION" as the destination directory.
4. Click on "DO IT" and look in the "DESTINATION" folder for the result.
